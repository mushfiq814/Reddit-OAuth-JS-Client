# JavaScript Reddit API Client

A simple reddit API client built with pure JS that logs in using OAuth 2.0.

## Setup

Create `.config/config.js` by duplicating `.config/config.example.js` and replacing the values with your reddit credentials that you can get from [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). You will need:

 - Reddit Client ID
 - Reddit Client Secret
 - Redirect URL
